# Simple web-based Business Health Dashboard for Indian Small & Medium Enterprises (MVP).

The product lets a small business owner:
• Enter 4 monthly numbers (revenue, expenses, cash in bank, top customer %)
• Instantly see a Health Score (Green / Yellow / Red)
• Get a simple explanation + 3 action steps (AI-assisted)

This is a lean MVP, not accounting or ERP software.


## Scope (5 Screens Only)

1. Welcome / Landing
2. Business Basics (type, city, sales range)
3. Monthly Inputs (revenue, expenses, cash, top customer %)
4. Health Score (0–100 + status)
5. Explanation & Actions


No charts. No integrations. No mobile app.

## Tech Stack (Preferred)
• Frontend: Next.js / React
• Styling: Tailwind CSS

• Hosting: Vercel


Health score logic is rule-based (provided).
